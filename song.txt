Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here for thirty mins
Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here, I need my things

I'm outside Pets at Home tryna find my dealer
He's in a Vauxhall Zafira, custom rims and a half-a-litre engine
But I just keep forgetting
I kinda wanna bell him but I've already belled him
He gets annoyed with how much I bell him

I just wanna tell him, what is the ETA?
I've been here pretending to be on my phone
I've got zero data, I'm scrolling notes
Pets at Home but they don't let pets in

I spent fifteen minutes on settings
I'm in Dunelm just looking at bedding
For a single bed that I rent in Epping
I'm dreading for him to come but don't wanna text him

Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here for thirty mins
Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here, I need my things

Where's this guy, man? Let's get to it, like
What the fuck is he doing?
I see him speeding, driving fast
Overtaking cars like Max did Lewis

Should I mention dangerous driving?
I think I'll just remind him
He almost killed the guy behind him
But he sells things that I need buying

He says, "Sorry to keep you waiting, I understand that it's raining"
I said, "No need to explain it, I know that your job is draining"
He said, "Nah man, I'm not complaining, I've been sat at home just gaming
The new God of War's amazing and I've been dabbling in"
