Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here for thirty mins
Why's this dealer taking the piss?
I've been standing here, I need my things

I'm outside Pets at Home tryna find my dealer
He's in a Vauxhall Zafira, custom rims and a half-a-litre engine
But I just keep forgetting
I kinda wanna bell him but I've already belled him
He gets annoyed with how much I bell him

I just wanna tell him, what is the ETA?
I've been here pretending to be on my phone
I've got zero data, I'm scrolling notes
Pets at Home but they don't let pets in

I spent fifteen minutes on settings
I'm in Dunelm just looking at bedding
For a single bed that I rent in Epping
I'm dreading for him to come but don't wanna text him
